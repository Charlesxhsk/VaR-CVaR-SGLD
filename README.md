# VaR-CVaR-SGLD
The paper "A fully data-driven approach to minimizing CVaR for portfolio of assets via SGLD with discontinuous updating" is from [1]
This is a class project for simulating VaR &amp; CVaR by using data driven SGLD method given in above paper.
The code given in this repo is asked for two main tasks:
First, implement the VaR-CVaR algorithm from Section 5.2. of the article with the same assumptions and parameter setting (single asset case) as per Table 1 & 2 of the
aforementioned article. And reproduce Table 1 & 2 (approximately).

Second, implement the VaR-CVaR algorithm for the case of three assets, i.e. for a portfolio which consists of three risky assets, as described in subsection 5.2.2., which is entitled \Minimizing CVaR
of portfolios of assets" of the article by examining the following 5 different cases:
| Asset 1 | Asset 2 | Asset 3 |
|   ----  |   ----  |   ----  |
| N(500,1)| N(0,10^6) | N(0,10^-4) |
| N(500,1)  |  N(0,10^6)  |  N(0,1)  |
| N(0,10^3) | N(0,1)  | N(0,4)  |
| N(0,1)  | N(1,4)  |  N(0,10^-4) |
|  N(0,1)  | N(1,4)  |  N(2,1)  |
at a confidence level 95% following the style of presentation of Table 3 of the aforementioned article.
